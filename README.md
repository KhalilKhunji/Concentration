# Concentration
--Work in Progress--

[Concentration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game)) is a type of card-based memory game. This particular variant is a simplified version of the classic 52-card game, taking 10 cards (5 pairs) for simplicity's sake. I assume there aren't as many people eager to memorize the position of 52 cards!
